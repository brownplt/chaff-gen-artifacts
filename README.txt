## 2020 Labelling and Clustering Evaluation

Excel spreadsheet that contains expert-labelled clusters, as well as the corresponding feature vectors for submissions in 2020.
Each wheat failing example is identified by a session, timestamp, and line number.

The following sheets contain tables linking each wheat failing example to a subproperty-based feature vector (also called a fingerprint)

- Docdiff-2020-Feature-Vectors
- Nile-2020-Feature-Vectors
- Filesystem-2020-Feature-Vectors

The following sheets contain a correspondence of each submission to its hand generated label, a conceptual fingerprint, alongside the relevant code used
for syntactic clustering.


- Docdiff-Consolidated-With-Code
- Nile-Consolidated-With-Code
- Filesystem-Consolidated-With-Code

These data were used to compute clustering metrics and compare  different clustering techniques.

This is where we get wheats and chaffs
