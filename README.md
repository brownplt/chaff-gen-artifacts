Conceptual Mutation Testing for Student Programming Misconceptions
by Siddhartha Prasad, Ben Greenman, Tim Nelson, and Shriram Krishnamurthi



## Contribution: A method to generate effective mutants at low cost by clustering and analyzing incorrect examples


The paper's first contribution involves a method that allows instructors to cluster and examine incorrect examples for student misunderstandings.
In doing so, we looked at 3 assignments (DocDiff, Nile, and Filesystem) from an accelerated introduction to computer science course from 2020.
We then:
1. Collected wheat-failing-examples
2. Labelled a sample of these failing-examples with associated misunderstandings to generate 'ground truth'.
3. Employed and evaluated various techniques to cluster these examples, comparing them against ground truth. Various clustering techniques required:
     - *Syntactic Clustering*: Student example code
     - *Semantic Clustering*: 
         - Characteristics of a correct solution deemed important by instructors
         - Mutant programs that violate these characteristics.
         - Feature vector for each incorrect example, generated by running wheat-failing-examples against all mutant programs.


### Artifact 1.1: Decomposition of Problems

A decomposition of the 3 assignments under study (DocDiff, Nile, Filesystem) into characteristics, mutant programs that violate these characteristics, and associated wheat programs can be found in the
`Assignment Decomposition` directory.


### Artifact 1.2: Labeled Submissions and Feature Vectors
While we do not share raw student submissions as part of our artifact, we provide a spreadsheet that provides relevant data. For each assignment, for each manually analyzed wheat failing example we provide:
- An id for each wheat-failing-example ( identified by a session, timestamp, and line number.)
- Relevant source code for the failing example in the Pyret language, alongside a Python translation (required for `GumTreeDiff`)
- The misunderstanding label used as ground truth.
- The corresponding feature vectors generated during semantic clustering.

These are available in `Clustering\2020 Labelling and Clustering.xlsx`
under the sheets `DocDiff-Consolidated`, `Nile-Consolidated`, and `Filesystem-Consolidated`.
 
### Artifact 1.3: Cluster Evaluation
We also provide a Python program and associated Docker container that can be used to generate both semantic and syntactic clusters using this spreadsheet, and generate clustering evaluation metrics as described in the paper.

Source code can be found in the `Clustering` directory. The Docker container that wraps this source code can be pulled from Dockerhub by running:
 `docker pull sidprasad/wfe-clustering`
 or built using the associated Dockerfile:

```
cd Clustering
docker build . -t sidprasad/wfe-clustering

```

It can then be run as follows:

```
docker run --rm -it sidprasad/wfe-clustering <option>
```

Where option can be one of `semantic`, `leveshtein` or `tree_diff`.

### Artifact 1.4: Semantic Clusters
We also provide the final results of clustering all student wheat failing examples by semantic clustering as part of a secondary Excel spreadsheet. We do not, however, do not share student code, only unique identifiers for each WFE.

These are available in `Clustering\2020 Labelling and Clustering.xlsx` under the sheets `DocDiff-2020-Feature-Vectors`, `Nile-2020-Feature-Vectors`, and `Filesystem-2020-Feature-Vectors`.
 
## Contribution: Evidence that Chaffs selected using our clustering method out-performed expert-written mutants.


Our second contribution involved evaluating chaffs generated using our clustering process that out-performed expert-written chaffs that had been finetuned over several years. This was done by examining the feature vectors created by wheat failing examples against chaffs presented to students.

### Artifact 2.1

Chaffs presented to students for each assignment for each year are available in the `Chaff Eval` directory. A mapping of characteristic to chaff can be found in `Chaff Eval\Characteristics to Chaff map.xlsx`


### Artifact 2.2

Feature vectors generated by running each wheat failing example against its corresponding chaff set are presented in `Chaff Eval\WFE-against-chaffs.xlsx`. These data are analyzed in Figure 4 and Table 9 of the paper. Once again, we do not provide raw student code but identify each wheat failing example by a unique id.
